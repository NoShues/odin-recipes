    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Jen discovered this recipe from a co-worker and it has become a family favorite.</p>
    <P>Laced with chocolate chips and served with broken waffle cones, this cannoli dip is guaranteed to be a party favorite!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup ricotta</li>
            <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2/3 cup mini chocolate chips</li>
            <li>waffle cones, broken into dippable pieces</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a stand mixer (or a hand mixer + large bowl), beat ricotta, cream cheese, and powdered sugar on medium-high speed until smooth, about 3-5 minutes. Add in vanilla extract and whip for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Taste test the dip, if you would like it sweeter, add more powdered sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time. You can safely add up to another Â½ cup of powdered sugar (8 tablespoons) without negatively impacting consistency.</li>
        <li>Fold in mini chocolate chips, reserving some to sprinkle on top for decoration, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve dip immediately with broken waffle cones for dipping.</li>

    </ol>
